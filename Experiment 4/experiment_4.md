# Experiment 4 Notes
## How much test coverage can a Large Language Model cover in a selected codebase?

#### Description of Experiment:
This one will be assessed through a tool which is built into the JetBrains IDEs. This is the test coverage feature. This will give you a percentage figure

The model will be provided with a class/set of functions, and will be expected to produce passing tests, and will be expected to be able to produce a high-level of tests for the whole codebase. The test coverage feature will help this. 

#### Codebase:  
A Ruby based console app. It will have various classes/modules. Therefore, you'll be able to write plenty of Unit Tests for it.
